== Gradle and Integration Tests

Details on adding custom integration/acceptance tests are at:

https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/ see the https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/Test.html

. Create a custom source set (directory structure) to hold the integration test source code separate from unit tests.
. Create a custom `integrationTest` task and set up its classpath path and source code paths to include the
integration test source code and test libraries (Junit 5).

Note that the new source set also creates keyword dependencies for `integrationTestCompile`, `integrationTestRuntime`
to allow integration test specific library dependencies in `build.gradle`.

Further custom source sets for other test types such as smoke tests, security tests, performance tests, etc. can be created and
executed separately.

- `./gradlew build` runs only the unit tests
- `./gradlew integrationTest` runs only the integration tests (it compiles all source code  beforehand).  It does not package or deploy a build.
This is assumed to have been done in a prior build pipeline step.

=== Test output

Gradle creates separate output directory structures for the test source sets.

The raw Junit XML is placed here:

- `build/test-results/test`
- `build/test-results/integrationTest`

The HTML formatted reports are placed here:
- `build/reports/tests/test`
- `build/reports/tests/integrationTest`

These files can be uploaded to an off-Travis location for viewing, aggregation, etc.

As well as file based output `testLogging` at the test method level for failed and passed tests has been configured.
This output appears on the Travis console.

== Technology stack
- Javalin framework
- Log4j2 + YAML
- Junit 5

=== Upgrading Gradle Wrapper

Change the version number in the `build.gradle` wrapper task then run:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=4.10.2 --distribution-type=bin`
